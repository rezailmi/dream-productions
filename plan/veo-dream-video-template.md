# Veo Dream Video Prompt Template (6-scene standard)

Source: reusable template provided in project context. Stored here for reuse.

```
8-second restrained memory fragment. FIRST-PERSON perspective throughout - {AGE}-year-old {NATIONALITY} {GENDER}'s point of view. Quiet, grounded, emotionally detached. JUMP CUTS between spaces without explanation. CRITICAL: NO UI elements whatsoever - no timestamps, no frame counters, no progress bars, no percentage indicators, no loading screens, no overlays. Clean cinematic output only. Subtle vignette (40% opacity) throughout.

[0-2s] {LOCATION_1}
Static first-person view. Looking at {FOCAL_OBJECT_1} in {SPACE_DESCRIPTION_1}. {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION_1}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_1} visible at {FRAME_POSITION_1}, {ACTION_STATE_1}. Muted {COLOR_PALETTE_1}. {AMBIENT_SOUND_1}. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_1}.

[2-3s] JUMP CUT - {LOCATION_2}
Abrupt JUMP CUT - now {SPATIAL_RELATIONSHIP_2}. Looking at {FOCAL_OBJECT_2}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_2} visible at {FRAME_POSITION_2}, {ACTION_STATE_2}. {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION_2}. Desaturated {COLOR_PALETTE_2}. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_2}.

[3-4s] JUMP CUT - {LOCATION_3}
JUMP CUT - {SPATIAL_RELATIONSHIP_3}. Looking at {FOCAL_OBJECT_3}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_3} {ACTION_STATE_3}. {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION_3}. {COLOR_PALETTE_3}. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_3}.

[4-5s] JUMP CUT - {LOCATION_4}
JUMP CUT - {SPATIAL_RELATIONSHIP_4}. Looking {DIRECTION_4} at {FOCAL_OBJECT_4}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_4} visible {FRAME_POSITION_4}. {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION_4}. {COLOR_PALETTE_4}. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_4}.

[5-7s] JUMP CUT - {LOCATION_5}
JUMP CUT - {SPATIAL_RELATIONSHIP_5}. Looking at {FOCAL_OBJECT_5}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_5} {ACTION_STATE_5}. {LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION_5}. {COLOR_PALETTE_5}. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_5}.

[7-8s] JUMP CUT - {LOCATION_6}
JUMP CUT - {SPATIAL_RELATIONSHIP_6}. Looking at {FOCAL_OBJECT_6}. Viewer's {BODY_PART_6} {ACTION_STATE_6}. Colors {COLOR_TRANSITION}. Fade to white. {EMOTIONAL_STATE_6}.

TRANSITIONS: Abrupt JUMP CUTS between disconnected {SPACE_TYPE}. Fragments of {THEME_HINT}. No narrative - just emotional residue.

COLORS: Desaturated throughout - {PRIMARY_COLOR_PALETTE}. No warmth. {EMOTIONAL_COLOR_DESCRIPTOR}.

LIGHTING: Natural, muted. {LIGHTING_LIST}. Never dramatic.

STYLE: "Severance" {STYLE_MODIFIER_1} meets "Eternal Sunshine" {STYLE_MODIFIER_2}. Minimal {VISUAL_APPROACH}. Restrained {NARRATIVE_APPROACH}.

FIRST-PERSON POV throughout. ABSOLUTELY NO surreal elements - no fantasy, no glowing. Only grounded, quiet spaces that hint at {CATEGORY_THEME} through {SYMBOLIC_METHOD}: {SYMBOL_LIST}.

MOOD: {MOOD_1} → {MOOD_2} → {MOOD_3} → {MOOD_4} → {MOOD_5} → {MOOD_6}. Each JUMP CUT fragments {EMOTIONAL_JOURNEY}.
