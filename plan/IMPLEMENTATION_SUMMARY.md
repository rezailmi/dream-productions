## 🎨 Design System

### Colors (Radix-based)
- **Primary**: Violet (#6e56cf) - Deep purple for branding
- **Secondary**: Blue (#0090ff) - Accent color
- **Success/Active**: Green (#30a46c) - Status indicators
- **Background**: Dark violet (#14121f) - Dreamy dark theme
- **Glass Effects**: Native iOS blur with semi-transparent overlays

### Typography
- Headers: 18-32px, bold (600-700)
- Body: 14-16px, regular
- System fonts for native iOS feel

### Components
- Rounded corners: 12-16px
- Glass morphism with BlurView
- Subtle borders and shadows
- Smooth animations and transitions

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Tab Navigation
✅ Three-tab bottom navigation:
- **Home**: Moon icon, empty state for dream display
- **Journal**: Book icon, empty state for archive
- **Profile**: Person icon, data source management

### Profile Screen
✅ Data source selection with three options:

1. **Apple Health Card**
   - Status: "Not Connected" (gray)
   - Shows "Coming Soon" alert on tap
   - Apple Health icon

2. **Whoop Card**
   - Status: "Not Connected" (gray)
   - Shows "Coming Soon" alert on tap
   - Fitness icon

3. **Demo Data Card**
   - Status: "Active" (green) - Default selected
   - Fully functional
   - Sparkles icon

### Demo Data
✅ 3 complete sleep sessions with:
- Date and time ranges
- Total duration in minutes
- Sleep quality ratings (poor/fair/good/excellent)
- Wake-up counts
- 4 REM cycles per session with:
  - Cycle number
  - Start time and duration
  - Interruption flags
  - Primary dream indicators
- Sleep stages (Core/Deep/REM/Awake) with timing
- Heart rate data:
  - Resting/Average/Min/Max BPM
  - Spikes with context (e.g., "During intense REM dream sequence")

### State Management
✅ HealthDataContext provides:
- Current data source tracking
- Sleep session storage
- Methods to switch sources
- Future-ready for API integrations

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### iOS Native Features
- ✅ BlurView for glass morphism effects
- ✅ SafeAreaView for notch/home indicator handling
- ✅ Platform-specific styling (iOS optimized)
- ✅ iOS 18.0+ deployment target
- ✅ HealthKit permissions pre-configured

### TypeScript
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ Full type coverage
- ✅ No `any` types
- ✅ Clean interfaces for all data structures

### Code Quality
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Meaningful variable names
- ✅ Comments for future integrations
- ✅ No linting errors

## 🧪 Build Verification

✅ **Successful iOS Export**
- Metro bundler: ✓
- Bundle size: 2.89 MB
- Assets: 42 files loaded
- Modules: 1,042 bundled
- No errors or warnings (except cosmetic NO_COLOR warnings)

## 📱 How to Run

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Run on iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Or scan QR code with Expo Go on iOS device
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Empty States
- **Home**: Moon icon with "Your dreams will appear here"
- **Journal**: Book icon with "Dream archive coming soon"
- Both have descriptive subtitles

### Profile Screen
- Large header: "Profile"
- Section: "Choose Your Data Source"
- Three glass-morphic cards with:
  - Icon with colored background
  - Title and description
  - Status badge (Active/Not Connected)
  - Smooth tap interactions
- Footer with app version

### Color Palette in Action
- Background: Deep violet gradient
- Cards: Glass effect with blur
- Active card: Violet glow
- Status badges: Green (active) or Gray (inactive)
- Text: White with varying opacity for hierarchy

## 🔮 Ready for Future Development

### Easy Integration Points
1. **Apple Health**: Context already prepared, just add HealthKit SDK calls
2. **Whoop**: OAuth flow can plug into existing data source switcher
3. **AI Dream Engine**: Sleep data structure ready for ML processing
4. **Dream Display**: Home screen ready for dream card components
5. **Journal Archive**: Screen ready for list/grid of past dreams

### Architecture Benefits
- Clean component separation
- Type-safe data flow
- Scalable state management
- Modular service layer
