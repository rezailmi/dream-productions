# WHOOP API Fix - Correction

## What Actually Happened

The initial migration documentation suggested that WHOOP had moved to a new domain `api.whoop.com` for their v2 API. However, **this domain doesn't actually exist or isn't publicly accessible yet**.

## The Real Issue

When testing the migration:
- ‚úÖ `api.prod.whoop.com` - **WORKS** (original domain)
- ‚ùå `api.whoop.com` - **DNS FAILS** (domain doesn't resolve)

This caused Safari to show "server can't be found" when trying to complete the OAuth flow.

## Actual Working Configuration

### OAuth Endpoints (Unchanged)
```
Authorization: https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth
Token: https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token
```

### API Base URL
```
Base URL: https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1
```

> ‚úÖ The server now defaults to this URL in `WhoopService` when no `WHOOP_API_BASE_URL` env var is present. The config log prints:
>
> `üìå WHOOP API Base URL: https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1 (default)`

### API Parameters
- WHOOP v1 caps `limit` at **25**. The service now enforces this cap and logs when it auto-adjusts a higher request.
- Responses now pass raw WHOOP records through to the client‚Äîno more synthetic mapping.

### Frontend Display
- `SleepDataCard` shows all WHOOP fields in a simple key/value list so the UI mirrors the raw payload.
- Dream generation remains available only for demo sessions until the pipeline can consume WHOOP records directly.

### API Endpoints (v1 format)
- Sleep data: `/activity/sleep`
- Sleep by ID: `/activity/sleep/{id}`
- Recovery: `/cycle/{id}/recovery`

## What Changed vs Original

The **improvements we kept**:
1. ‚úÖ **Default date parameters** - Now defaults to last 30 days
2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced logging** - Request/response interceptors for debugging
3. ‚úÖ **Better error handling** - More informative error messages
4. ‚úÖ **Configurable base URL** - Via `WHOOP_API_BASE_URL` env var

The **changes we reverted**:
1. ‚ùå OAuth URLs - Back to `api.prod.whoop.com`
2. ‚ùå API base URL - Back to `api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1`
3. ‚ùå Endpoint paths - Back to v1 format (`/activity/sleep`, not `/sleep`)

## Current Status

### Files Updated
1. `server/src/routes/auth.ts` - OAuth URLs back to `api.prod.whoop.com`
2. `server/src/services/whoopService.ts` - Base URL and endpoints reverted to v1
3. `server/src/config.ts` - Config logging updated
4. `server/src/routes/whoop.ts` - Error messages updated

- **Updated (Oct 18, 2025)**
  - ‚úÖ OAuth flow completes successfully
  - ‚úÖ Safari can access WHOOP's login page
  - ‚úÖ API endpoints are accessible (`/activity/sleep`, `/activity/sleep/{id}`, `/cycle/{id}/recovery`)
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced logging and error handling (request/response interceptors)
  - ‚úÖ Default date parameters for better compatibility
  - ‚úÖ Backend maps v1 payloads into `SleepSession[]`

## Why the Initial Migration Info Was Wrong

The migration documentation found online was either:
1. **Future-looking** - Describing a migration that hasn't happened yet
2. **Incomplete** - The new domain isn't set up yet
3. **Inaccurate** - Based on beta/internal information not publicly available

## Testing Verification

```bash
# OAuth endpoints - Working
curl -I https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth
# Returns: HTTP/2 405 ‚úÖ

# API endpoints - Working (returns 401 = needs auth, but endpoint exists)
curl -I https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/activity/sleep
# Returns: HTTP/2 401 ‚úÖ

# New domain - NOT working
curl -I https://api.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth
# Returns: Could not resolve host ‚ùå
```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Try OAuth flow again** - Should now work correctly
2. **Authorize in WHOOP** - Safari will successfully load the page
3. **Get redirected back** - With access token
4. **Fetch sleep data** - API calls will work

## Future Migration

When WHOOP actually migrates to the new domain structure:
- We have the `WHOOP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable ready
- Can quickly switch by setting env var
- Logging will help identify when migration happens
- Documentation is in place for the changes needed

## Lesson Learned

Always **verify API endpoints are actually accessible** before migrating, especially when:
- Documentation mentions future dates
- Domain changes are involved
- No official announcement from the service
- Can't find corroborating sources

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ OAuth flow working  
**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**API Version**: v1 on api.prod.whoop.com  
**Next Check**: Monitor for actual v2/domain migration
