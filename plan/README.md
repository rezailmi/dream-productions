# Planning & Design Documentation

This folder contains planning documents, design specifications, and technical architecture files generated during the development of Dream Machine.

## Contents

- **SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide for the Dream Machine app (WHOOP, Groq, Fal.ai)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical implementation details and architecture breakdown
- **MIGRATION_TO_FALAI.md** - Migration guide from Google Veo to Fal.ai Veo3
- **WHOOP_DATA_STRUCTURE.md** - Technical explanation of WHOOP API data structure and REM cycle generation algorithm
- **expo-dream-app-init.plan.md** - Initial project setup plan

## Organization

- All generated markdown documentation files should be stored here
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for file names (e.g., `FEATURE_PLAN.md`, `API_DESIGN.md`)
- Exception: Only root-level docs like `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` stay at project root
- Setup guides, migration guides, and implementation docs all go in this folder

## Purpose

This folder keeps planning and design documentation organized and separate from user-facing documentation and implementation code.
