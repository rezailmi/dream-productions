# Project Organization Update

## Changes Made

Successfully organized project documentation and created Cursor AI rules for better project management.

## What Changed

### 1. Created `.cursorrules` File (Root)
**Location:** `/.cursorrules`

A comprehensive AI assistant rules file that defines:
- Code style and TypeScript standards
- React Native & Expo best practices
- File naming conventions
- Component structure guidelines
- **Documentation rule: All plans and documentation go in `/plan` folder**
- Native iOS design guidelines
- State management patterns
- Testing checklist
- Git workflow

### 2. Created `/plan` Folder
**Purpose:** Central location for all project documentation

All markdown files moved from root to `/plan`:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
- `LIQUID_GLASS_TABS.md` - Native tabs guide
- `NATIVE_TABS_UPDATE.md` - Migration details

### 3. Created Index File
**Location:** `/plan/INDEX.md`

A navigation hub for all documentation with:
- Quick links to all docs
- "Need to..." sections for common tasks
- Project structure overview
- Quick command reference
- Design system summary

### 4. Added .gitkeep
**Location:** `/plan/.gitkeep`

Ensures the plan folder is tracked by Git even if empty.

## Benefits

### Clean Root Directory
✅ Only essential config files in root
✅ All documentation in dedicated folder
✅ Easier to navigate project structure

### Better Documentation
✅ Centralized documentation location
✅ Easy to find relevant guides
✅ Index file for quick navigation

### AI Assistant Integration
✅ Cursor follows consistent rules
✅ Automatically saves plans to `/plan` folder
✅ Maintains code style and standards
✅ Documents integration points

### Team Collaboration
✅ Clear guidelines for contributors
✅ Documented patterns and practices
✅ Consistent file organization

## Cursor Rules Highlights

Key rules now in place:

### Documentation
- **All plans go in `/plan` folder**
- Update existing files rather than creating duplicates
- Include overview, files affected, code snippets, testing

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components only
- Platform-specific code with Platform.select()
- Comments for future integration points

### iOS Design
- Radix colors in semantic tokens
- SF Symbols for native icons
- Glass effects with expo-blur
- Spacing in multiples of 4 or 8

### Project Patterns
- React Context for global state
- Custom hooks for context access
- SafeAreaView for all screens
- StyleSheet.create for styles

## Usage

### For Developers

When working on the project:
1. Read relevant docs in `/plan` folder
2. Follow patterns in `.cursorrules`
3. Save any new plans to `/plan`
4. Update existing docs when adding features

### For AI Assistants

Cursor will automatically:
1. Follow code style guidelines
2. Save plans to `/plan` folder
3. Maintain consistent patterns
4. Document new features properly

## Finding Documentation

**Main overview:**
→ `/plan/README.md`

**Quick reference:**
→ `/plan/QUICK_START.md` or `/plan/INDEX.md`

**Native tabs guide:**
→ `/plan/LIQUID_GLASS_TABS.md`

**Implementation details:**
→ `/plan/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Project rules:**
→ `/.cursorrules` (in root)

## Next Steps

The project is now well-organized with:
- ✅ Clear documentation structure
- ✅ AI assistant guidelines
- ✅ Consistent code patterns
- ✅ Clean project root

Ready for development with proper documentation and organization! 🎉
