# WHOOP Dream Generation Fix

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Problem

The generate button for WHOOP data was disabled with a "coming soon" message. Users couldn't generate dreams from their actual WHOOP sleep data.

## Solution

Enabled dream generation for WHOOP data by:

1. **Mapping WHOOP Records to SleepSession** - WHOOP records are now automatically mapped to the SleepSession format required by the backend
2. **Enabling Generate Button** - The button is now active and functional for WHOOP data
3. **Supporting Failed Dream Retry** - Users can now retry generation if a dream fails

## Changes Made

### 1. `components/SleepDataCard.tsx`
**Lines 297-316** - Replaced disabled button with functional generate button
- Removed "coming soon" message
- Added loading state with ActivityIndicator
- Connected to onGenerate callback
- Shows "Generate Dream" text when ready
- Shows "Generating..." when processing

### 2. `contexts/HealthDataContext.tsx`
**Lines 121-149** - Enhanced `generateDream` function to support WHOOP data
- Checks if session is already a SleepSession
- If not (WHOOP record), maps it using `mapWhoopRecordToSleepSession`
- Handles mapping errors gracefully with user-friendly alerts
- Sends mapped SleepSession to backend for generation

### 3. `components/DayCard.tsx`
**Line 112** - Added failed dream retry support
- Button now shows for: no dream, generating dream, OR failed dream
- Allows users to retry failed generations

### 4. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
**Line 51** - Fixed loading state timing
- Changed from `dream?.status === 'generating'` to `isGeneratingDream || dream?.status === 'generating'`
- Button now shows loading state immediately when clicked (not waiting for dream object creation)
- Ensures button is disabled and shows spinner right away

## Flow

```
User clicks "Generate Dream"
    ↓
SleepDataCard.onGenerate()
    ↓
DayCard.onGenerate()
    ↓
HomeScreen.handleGenerate(date)
    ↓
HealthDataContext.generateDream(sleepSessionId)
    ↓
1. Find WHOOP record by ID
2. Map to SleepSession format
3. Send to backend API
    ↓
Backend (server/src/)
    ↓
1. groqService generates narrative + oneiromancy
2. veoService generates video using template
3. Returns complete dream
    ↓
Frontend updates UI with dream result
```

## Backend Integration

The backend already had full support for:

- **Narrative Generation** (`server/src/services/groqService.ts`)
  - Uses Groq Llama 3.3 70B model
  - Generates title, narrative, scenes, mood, emotional context
  - Includes Oneiromancy prediction (summary, themes, symbols, advice, category, confidence)

- **Video Generation** (`server/src/services/dreamGenerationService.ts`)
  - Uses Google Veo or Fal.ai Veo3 (configurable)
  - Applies 6-scene Veo template from `veoPromptTemplate.ts`
  - Creates 8-second first-person POV dream video

- **Template System** (`server/src/promptTemplates/veoPromptTemplate.ts`)
  - Category-based symbol selection (Wealth, Love, Career, etc.)
  - Sleep metric-driven scene composition
  - Minimal, "Severance"-style aesthetic
  - See: `/plan/veo-dream-video-template.md`

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. ✅ Connect WHOOP account in Profile tab
2. ✅ Navigate to home screen
3. ✅ Find a day with WHOOP sleep data
4. ✅ Scroll to "Stats" view (3rd tab)
5. ✅ Click "Generate Dream" button
6. ✅ Button shows "Generating..." with spinner
7. ✅ Wait for backend processing (~30-60 seconds)
8. ✅ Dream appears with narrative and video
9. ✅ Oneiromancy appears in "Insights" tab

### Expected Results
- Button is enabled for WHOOP data
- Loading state shows during generation
- Success: Dream with video and insights appears
- Failure: Error alert shown, button remains for retry
- Demo data generation still works as before

## Files Changed

```

- `/plan/WHOOP_TO_VEO_MAPPING.md` - WHOOP data to Veo variable mapping
- `/plan/WHOOP_API_V2_MIGRATION.md` - WHOOP API integration details

## Known Limitations

1. Video generation depends on Google Veo or Fal.ai availability
2. If video fails, dream still completes with narrative only
3. Generation takes 30-60 seconds (UX could be improved with progress updates)
4. Oneiromancy confidence is AI-generated and may vary

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add progress updates during generation (narrative → video stages)
- [ ] Cache generated dreams to avoid re-generation
- [ ] Add option to regenerate just video if it fails
- [ ] Support batch generation for multiple days
- [ ] Add dream sharing/export functionality

## Success Metrics

✅ Generate button enabled for WHOOP data  
✅ No linter errors introduced  
✅ Graceful error handling with user feedback  
✅ Retry capability for failed generations  
✅ Full integration with existing backend templates  

---

**Implementation Complete** - Users can now generate dreams from their WHOOP sleep data with full narrative and oneiromancy insights.
